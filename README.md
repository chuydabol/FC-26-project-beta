# FC-26 Project Beta

## API

### `GET /api/players`

Fetch players from EA Pro Clubs. You may pass one or more club IDs as a comma-separated
`clubId`/`clubIds` query string. If omitted, the server falls back to the
`LEAGUE_CLUB_IDS` environment variable.

The response shape is `{ members: [], byClub: { [clubId]: [] } }` where `members` is the
deduplicated union list and `byClub` maps each club ID to its members. Results are cached
for 60 seconds.

#### Environment

`LEAGUE_CLUB_IDS` â€“ comma-separated default club IDs used when the route is called
without specifying a `clubId`.
